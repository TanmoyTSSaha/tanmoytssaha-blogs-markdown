description: "Worked on developing near real-time data pipeline along with optimising existing projects"
---

## Overview

At SpiceJet, I worked as a data engineer on there big data infrastructure by optimising existing project and created a new nearly real-time data pipeline for analytics purpose.

---

## Key Responsibilities

- Reduced S3 storage by 45 percent by implementing and optimizing Life Cycle Policies (LCP), including removal of obsolete data and non-functional policies through strategic auditing and analysis of usage patterns.
- Boosted Spark job performance by narrowing data scans and eliminating redundant transformations, resulting in faster execution and reduced compute costs.
- Developed an AI MCP Tool that automated the development and deployment of real-time data pipelines, integrated with Cursor AI Agent — reducing deployment time from 2 hours of manual efforts to just 30 minutes of AI base automation.
- Refactored the batch data pipeline codebase by removing flat-file dependencies and centralizing metadata storage in a database, making it accessible through APIs for easier integration and maintenance.
- Improved internal monitoring dashboards by redesigning the UI and integrating additional metrics and alerting capabilities for better observability.
- Worked on migrating streaming pipeline on organisational level migration which include migrating many microservices supporting the streaming pipeline.
- Worked on optimizing and adding new BAU reqirements on the existing batch and streaming pipeline. 
- Participated in oncalls and solved major bugs.

---

## Key Achievements

- Reduced and optimized the S3 storage which directly effected in reducing the cost.
- Participated in organizational level migration and migrated microservices supporting streaming pipeline.
- Developed AI based MCP server which onboarding and deployment process of BAU tasks in streaming pipeline easy.
- Improved the UI of existing portal and added monitoring metrices using grafana directly into the portal.
- Participated in Oncalls and fixed some major bugs during oncall and supported the smooth running of jobs.

---

## Impact

- Solved major bugs and supported the smooth running of jobs.
- Improved onboarding of BAU tasks from 2 Days to few hours.
- Impacted in reducing cost by optimizing S3 storage.
