Ever wonder what actually happens when you click "Send" on an email or join a video call? Every click, message, and API call on the internet relies on network protocols. They define how data moves, who can talk, and how securely it all happens.

At the foundation are transport protocols: TCP ensures reliable delivery, UDP prioritizes speed, and QUIC brings both worlds together over UDP.

On top of that, HTTP powers the web, TLS secures it, and DNS translates names into addresses.

Need remote access? That’s SSH. File transfers? SFTP or SMB.

Real-time chat and media? WebSocket, WebRTC, and MQTT keep data flowing live.

For identity and access, OAuth and OpenID handle authorization and authentication.

In the backend, DHCP, NTP, ICMPv6, and LDAP quietly keep everything synchronized, addressed, and discoverable.

From simple emails (SMTP, IMAP) to encrypted VPNs (WireGuard, IPsec), these protocols form the invisible language that keeps the internet connected and secure.

Over to you: If one protocol suddenly stopped working worldwide, which one would break the internet first?
