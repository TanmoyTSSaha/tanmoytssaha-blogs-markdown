The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has evolved over the years to meet the needs of modern applications, from simple text delivery to high-performance, real-time experiences.<br>
Here is how HTTP has progressed:

- HTTP/0.9: Built to fetch simple HTML documents with a single GET request.
    
- HTTP/1.0: Added headers and status codes to support richer interactions, but every request still required a new connection.
    
- HTTP/1.1: Introduced persistent connections and more methods, making the web faster and more efficient for everyday browsing.
    
- HTTP/2: Solved performance bottlenecks with multiplexing, enabling multiple requests to share one connection.
    
- HTTP/3 (QUIC): Shifted to UDP with QUIC to reduce latency and improve reliability, especially for mobile and real-time apps.
    

Over to you: Are you already taking advantage of HTTP/3 in your projects?
