There’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all database anymore. Modern applications rely on multiple database types, from real-time analytics to vector search for AI. Knowing which type to use can make or break your system’s performance.

- Relational: Traditional row-and-column databases, great for structured data and transactions.

- Columnar: Optimized for analytics, storing data by columns for fast aggregations.

- Key-Value: Stores data as simple key–value pairs, enabling fast lookups.

- In-memory: Stores data in RAM for ultra-low latency lookups, ideal for caching or session management.

- Wide-Column: Handles massive amounts of semi-structured data across distributed nodes.

- Time-series: Specialized for metrics, logs, and sensor data with time as a primary dimension.

- Immutable Ledger: Ensures tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable transaction logs.

- Graph: Models complex relationships, perfect for social networks and fraud detection

- Document: Flexible JSON-like storage, great for modern apps with evolving schemas.

- Geospatial: Manages location-aware data such as maps, routes, and spatial queries.

- Text-search: Full-text indexing and search with ranking, filters, and analytics.

- Blob: Stores unstructured objects like images, videos, and files.

- Vector: Powers AI/ML apps by enabling similarity search across embeddings.
